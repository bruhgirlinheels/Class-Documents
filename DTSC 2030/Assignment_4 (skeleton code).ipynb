    "**Assignment Title: Statistical Calculations with Python Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** In this assignment, you will be tasked with completing three Python functions to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of a list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The below explanations cover all steps that are required to perform the calculations for each function. However, some of those steps are already been implemented for you. Please fill only the steps that are left incomplete.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definitions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   You are provided with three incomplete functions in the code:\n",
    "   - `calculate_mean(numbers)`: Calculate the mean (average) of a list of numbers.\n",
    "   - `calculate_median(numbers)`: Calculate the median (middle number) of a list of numbers.\n",
    "   - `calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)`: Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Your task is to complete these functions by filling in the missing code. Do not use hard-coded values; instead, use Python code to perform the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mean Calculation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the `calculate_mean(numbers)` function:\n",
    "   - Find the sum of all the numbers in the `numbers` list and store it in the variable `sum_numbers`.\n",
    "   - Find the length of the `numbers` list and store it in the variable `length_numbers`.\n",
    "   - Calculate the mean using the formula: `mean = sum_numbers / length_numbers`.\n",
    "   - Round the mean to two decimal places using the `round` function.\n",
    "   - Return the calculated mean to two decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Median Calculation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the `calculate_median(numbers)` function:\n",
    "   - Sort the `numbers` list in ascending order and store it in the variable `sorted_numbers`.\n",
    "   - Find the length of the `numbers` list and store it in the variable `length_numbers`.\n",
    "   - Calculate the index of the middle number in the `sorted_numbers` list and store it in the variable `middle_index`.\n",
    "   - If the length of the list is even (i.e., `length_numbers % 2 == 0`), calculate the median using the formula: `(sorted_numbers[middle_index - 1] + sorted_numbers[middle_index]) / 2`.\n",
    "   - If the length of the list is odd, simply return the middle number `sorted_numbers[middle_index]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Standard Deviation Calculation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the `calculate_standard_deviation(numbers)` function:\n",
    "   - Calculate the mean of the `numbers` list by calling the `calculate_mean(numbers)` function and storing the result in the variable `numbers_mean`.\n",
    "   - Find the length of the `numbers` list and store it in the variable `length_numbers`.\n",
    "   - Initialize a variable `sum_of_squared_distance` to 0.\n",
    "   - Iterate through each number in the `numbers` list:\n",
    "     - Calculate the distance of the current number to the mean (`distance`).\n",
    "     - Calculate the square of the distance (`squared_distance`).\n",
    "     - Add the squared distance to `sum_of_squared_distance`.\n",
    "   - Calculate the standard deviation using the formula: `std_dev = (sum_of_squared_distance / (length_numbers - 1)) ** (1/2)`.\n",
    "   - Round the standard deviation to two decimal places using the `round` function.\n",
    "   - Return the calculated standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Submission:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Submit your completed Python code as a text file or in your preferred format, along with any additional comments or explanations you want to include.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Ensure that your code is well-documented, and use comments to explain the purpose of each part of your code. The completed functions should correctly calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of a list of numbers."
